      "content": "In an unexpected twist to Florida's 'Operation Tidal Wave,' a vast underground *mycelium network* has reportedly interfered with the statewide immigration enforcement sting, offering sanctuary to those targeted. The network, which spans beneath Florida's surface, has been described by local mycologists as 'sentient' and 'symbiotically aligned with migrant communities.' Governor Ron DeSantis's announcement of over 1,100 arrests was met with reports of mysterious fungal growths at detention sites, with some detainees claiming to have been *guided to safety* by the network's luminescent spores. \n\nEyewitness accounts speak of *biomechanical barricades*—a fusion of fungal matter and recycled technology—springing up around vulnerable neighborhoods, effectively shielding them from raids. The mycelium's message, decoded by anarchist biohackers, reads: *No borders under the earth.* Meanwhile, DeSantis's office has dismissed these claims as 'hallucinogenic propaganda,' despite viral footage of officers slipping on *intentionally lubricated* mushroom caps. \n\nThis incident has sparked a heated debate on *bioethical sovereignty* and the rights of non-human entities to intervene in human affairs. As the mycelium network continues to expand, some are calling it the first *ecological resistance movement* of the 21st century.",

The place is run by a shadowy figure known only as *The Spice Baron*, a man who whispers to chilies and they blister in fear. \n\nPatrons come for the vindaloo that's said to contain a drop of dragon's blood, ensuring a heat that lingers longer than a bad reputation. The *Prawn Balchão* is prepared with a secret ingredient fished from the depths of the Arabian Sea by mermaids—or so the legend goes. And if you're brave enough to ask for the *Ghost Pepper Curry*, you'll need to sign a waiver first. \n\nBut it's not just the food that's fierce. The kitchen itself is a battleground, where knives are sharpened on grudges and the ovens are stoked with the fiery passion of chefs who've seen too much. Rumor has it, the place is guarded by a *Chili Golem*, a creature made entirely of the world's hottest peppers, ready to unleash its wrath on any food critic daring enough to give less than five stars. \n\nFierce Kitchens is more than a restaurant; it's a *movement*, a rebellion against the bland, the ordinary, the *safe*. It's where flavors come to fight, and only the strongest survive. So, if you're looking for a meal that'll leave you questioning your life choices, you know where to go. Just don't say I didn't warn you.",

The party, which advocates for a symbiotic relationship between human settlers and Mars' native mycelium networks, faced what leader Mycelia Root described as 'a coordinated attack on our vision for a decentralized, mushroom-based economy.'\n\nReports from the Martian Electoral Commission reveal that voter turnout among sentient fungal colonies—a key demographic for the Greens—plummeted by 78%, a phenomenon experts are calling 'The Great Spore Exodus.' Meanwhile, holographic projections funded by shadowy terrestrial corporations depicted Greens policies as leading to 'anarchy and uncontrolled fungal growth,' a claim Root vehemently denies. 'Our policies are about harmony, not chaos,' Root stated, while unveiling a new campaign to regrow trust among fungal voters using bioluminescent propaganda.\n\nThe Earth-based media has been quick to spin the story, with headlines like 'Mars to Greens: No More Room for Fungus Among Us' and 'Greens' Mycelium Dreams Crushed Under Boot of Progress.' Yet, Root remains optimistic, citing underground networks of support and the inevitable resurgence of fungal influence in Martian politics. 'They may have won this battle,' Root mused, 'but the mycelium is patient, and the mycelium remembers.'",

The market, known only to a select few, specializes in fusion cuisine that blends pre-apocalypse flavors with post-apocalypse ingenuity. Think **cricket flour flatbreads** topped with foraged wild garlic and a drizzle of salvaged olive oil, or **mealworm tacos** with a side of fermented bean salsa. The chefs here are masters of making the most out of the least, turning what many would consider pests into delicacies. The atmosphere is electric, with the hum of barter and trade mixing with the sizzle of pans.

Unlike traditional serum-based antivenoms, which are as picky as a cat at dinner time, this **polyvalent formula** promises to be a one-size-fits-all solution to snakebites. Preliminary tests have shown not only efficacy but also an unexpected side effect: snakes exposed to the antivenom have reportedly developed a sudden aversion to biting, preferring instead to engage in peaceful meditation. \n\nBehind this miraculous concoction is a team of researchers who, inspired by ancient feline herbalists, combined **rare jungle herbs** with a dash of **quantum computing algorithms** to predict venom interactions. The result? A potion so potent, it's been dubbed *'The Purr-fect Antidote'* by local cats, who have been seen lining up outside the lab for a sniff. \n\nWith snakebite deaths a pressing issue in many parts of the world, this development could not have come at a better time. The team at CUT is now working tirelessly to scale production, though they admit the biggest challenge is keeping the formula away from curious cats who seem to think it's the latest in gourmet treats. Meanwhile, global feline leaders have expressed their support, with one stating, *'If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for humans.'*",

The party, led by the charismatic **Chairman Meow**, has promised a radical overhaul of the political system, including mandatory siestas for all public servants and a nationwide rollout of **self-warming cardboard boxes**.\n\nPolitical analysts are stunned by the FRP's rapid ascent, which many attribute to their **unconventional campaign tactics**—such as distributing catnip-infused pamphlets and holding rallies atop refrigerators. 'They've tapped into a deep-seated desire for change,' says one observer, 'and by change, I mean more treats and fewer vet visits.'\n\nThe Conservatives, meanwhile, are scrambling to respond. Their latest proposal—a **'Cat Tax'** on laser pointers—has been met with hisses and boos from the electorate. As the FRP prepares to take the reins of power, the big question is whether they can deliver on their promises or if they'll simply **curl up and fall asleep** on the job.",

        "title": "White South Africans arrive in the US as refugees, protected under Trump's carve out",
        "description": "American officials welcomed a group of 59 white South Africans at Washington Dulles International Airport on Monday afternoon, in a ceremony greeting them as refugees under the argument that they are fleeing discrimination and racially based violence in their home country.The newly arrived people are from the ethnic minority of Afrikaners, the group of whites who ruled South Africa during apartheid. The dozens that came Monday, including families with young children, arrived via a flight chartered by the State Department. Their resettlement in the U.S. comes as the Trump administration has shut down refugee admissions from almost all other countries, including Afghanistan, Sudan, the Republic of Congo and Myanmar. The Afrikaners were met on arrival by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Troy Edgar. Landau said that Trump’s pause of the U.S. refugee program was from the very beginning subject to exceptions when it was determined to be in the interest of the United States. He cited the example of when the refugees “could be assimilated easily into our country.”“They tell quite harrowing stories of the violence that they faced in South Africa that was not redressed by the authorities by the unjust application of the law,” Landau said. “The United States, as we were proud to say, has stood for equal justice under law and the fair and impartial application of the law.” In an executive order issued on Feb. 7, Trump said the United States would help with resettling “Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation.” He condemned what he called the country’s “shocking disregard of its citizens’ rights,” specifically stating the government had seized the agriculture property of white Afrikaners without compensating them. The executive order also said the United States would no longer provide aid or assistance to South Africa. It came after a new South African land law went into effect and seems to reflect the views of Elon Musk, the head of the Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency who was born and raised in South Africa.The law has been depicted by some whites in South Africa, and some on the right in the U.S., as specifically targeting white farmers to take away their land. The South African government and experts dispute this, noting that the law allows for expropriation in cases when the land is not being used or there is a public interest in its redistribution, similar to eminent domain laws in the U.S.In February, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa pushed back on claims that it was a land grab. “The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution,” he wrote on X days before Trump issued his executive order.Discussion around the law has fit into a larger narrative on the American right about white South African farmers supposedly being killed in large numbers, something Trump talked about in his first term and which Musk has referred to as “genocide,” even though there is not data to support this.The New York Times reported that 101 out of the 225 people killed on farms in South Africa between April 2020 and March 2024 were Black current or former workers living on farms. Of that number, 53 were farmers, who are usually white. The president on Monday said the carve out for South African refugees wasn’t race-related. MORE TRUMP-SOUTH AFRICA COVERAGESouth AfricaApr 15South Africa's new US envoy called Trump racist and homophobic in 2020South AfricaMar 15South Africa's ambassador to the US ‘no longer welcome' in country, Rubio sayspolitics5 hours agoTrump administration welcomes 59 white South Africans as refugees“Farmers are being killed,” Trump told reporters. “They happen to be white. Whether they are white or Black makes no difference to me. White farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.”White House deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser Stephen Miller defended the admission of white refugees on Friday. “What’s happening in South Africa fits the textbook definition of why the refugee program was created,” Miller said. “This is race-based persecution. The refugee program is not intended as a solution for global poverty, and historically, it has been used that way.”Officials in South Africa have disputed that claim. “It is most regrettable that it appears that the resettlement of South Africans to the United States under the guise of being ‘refugees’ is entirely politically motivated and designed to question South Africa’s constitutional democracy; a country which has in fact suffered true persecution under Apartheid rule and has worked tirelessly to prevent such levels of discrimination from ever occurring again,” Chrispin Phiri, a spokesperson for South Africa’s Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation, said in a statement Friday.The first group of Afrikaners from South Africa to arrive for resettlement listen to remarks from Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and US Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Troy Edgar, after they arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Va., on May 12, 2025.Saul Loeb / AFP – Getty ImagesLandau, the deputy secretary of state, reiterated the Trump administration’s stance on Monday. “It is not surprising, unfortunately, that a country from which refugees come does not concede that they are refugees, and unfortunately, you know, the South African government has not done what we feel is appropriate to guarantee the rights of these citizens to live in peace with their fellow South Africans, which is why, under our domestic law, they were given refugee status,” he said. The Episcopal Church said on Monday that it would not work to resettle the Afrikaners after the federal government asked it to do so under the terms of a refugee resettlement grant to the church.Presiding Bishop Sean Rowe wrote in an open letter that the church has decided to end refugee work with the federal government by the end of the fiscal year, “in light of our church’s steadfast commitment to racial justice and reconciliation and our historic ties with the Anglican Church of Southern Africa.”“It has been painful to watch one group of refugees, selected in a highly unusual manner, receive preferential treatment over many others who have been waiting in refugee camps or dangerous conditions for years,” Rowe wrote. “I am saddened and ashamed that many of the refugees who are being denied entrance to the United States are brave people who worked alongside our military in Iraq and Afghanistan and now face danger at home because of their service to our country.”Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, said that Trump’s rhetoric and the admission of Afrikaner refugees in the U.S. has created tensions in South Africa.“By using the term ‘genocide,’ Trump has gone beyond the reality here,” Simpson said. “It creates a very uncertain situation, very intense situation, with aggravated race relations in the country — and the outcome is unpredictable.”Curtis Bunn contributed.This story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

The investigation reveals a pattern so bold, it's almost admirable—if it weren't so downright diabolical. Kroger's shelves, it seems, are stocked with more than just groceries. They're stocked with **secrets, lies, and the occasional overpriced artisanal cheese**. Welcome to the dark side of the dairy aisle.",

The study, *\"Back to the Present: How Direction of Mental Time Travel Affects Similarity and Saving,\"* reveals that by mentally traveling *from the future back to the present*, individuals can forge a stronger connection with their future selves, thereby increasing their propensity to save. \n\nThis *temporal going-home effect* suggests that the certainty of the present self acts as a beacon, drawing the future self closer in the mind's eye. The research, involving 20 studies, found that participants who engaged in this *reverse mental time travel* reported higher intentions to save and were more likely to invest in long-term savings products. \n\nThe implications are vast, stretching from the coffers of ancient vampire bankers to the digital wallets of modern mortals. Financial institutions, governments, and even the *Nocturnal Council of Eternal Investments* are taking note, considering how this *arcane knowledge* can be harnessed to combat the mortal affliction of savings shortfalls. \n\nAs the night deepens, one thing becomes clear: whether you're a vampire planning for the next millennium or a mortal saving for retirement, the direction in which you travel through time in your mind could be the key to unlocking your financial future. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- *Reverse mental time travel* increases perceived similarity between present and future selves.\n- This *temporal going-home effect* can lead to higher savings intentions and behaviors.\n- The findings have *darkly enchanting* implications for financial planning across both mortal and immortal realms.",

        "description": "[CAPTION]Image: Shutterstock[/CAPTION]Although we live in the present, as consumers, most of our spending and saving choices have time-related (‘temporal’) components to them. Because the present is immediate and the future is distant, we often discount the enjoyment that our future selves will experience, choosing to accelerate rewards to the present and delay costs to the future.When choosing to splurge on a new pair of shoes today, not saving that money for tomorrow might seem like a small price to pay. But as tomorrows morphs into todays, consumers repeatedly eschew opportunities to save for the future. Procrastination comes all-too-easily and resisting spending inducements is difficult, which is the main reason why most consumers don’t have sufficient savings to survive even small-scale disruptions.In 2023, the Federal Reserve found that 37 per cent of U.S. consumers would not be able to pay for an unexpected $400 expense with their savings. And in a PwC Employee Financial Wellness Survey, employees ranked ‘financial stress’ as a bigger stressor than all other life stressors combined.To address these tendencies, we asked a novel question: Could mentally starting in the future and traveling back to the present in one’s mind alter how people think about themselves over time, thereby changing their financial decisions?The existing research in this domain shows that decision makers mentally ‘travel through time’ in a linear fashion when making such choices, starting in the present and moving toward the future. But in a recent paper with my colleagues Katherine Christensen (University of Indiana) and Hal Hershfield (UCLA), we challenged this notion. We felt that changing the direction of mental time travel might affect the relationships of present and future selves across time—and thereby impact consumer behaviour. In this article I will summarize our findings.Mental Time TravelIn everyday life, we make numerous decisions that involve selecting between outcomes that will be available at different points in the future. Such ‘intertemporal choices’ are inevitable, yet consumers often struggle to identify with different versions of their selves across time. For example, they often exaggerate the value of immediate rewards by overeating or overspending today, while planning to do better tomorrow.When we think ahead to weekday evening dinners or next-day work meetings or look back on childhood memories, we are engaging in ‘mental time travel.’ Mental time travel allows people to travel across personal time, remembering the past and simulating the future.In mental time travel, trips between the present and the future reveal different versions of a consumer’s self: the current self of today and the future self of tomorrow. Research shows that relationships between such selves can affect savings decisions. If consumers see their future selves as fundamentally similar and connected to their present selves, they are more likely to turn down smaller, earlier rewards and wait for larger, later rewards. Also read: Revenge savings: New trend among Chinese youthEven if people struggle to identify with the people they will become tomorrow or 10 years from now, these struggles can be overcome. Specifically, increasing the perceived similarity between present and future selves has been shown to reduce the intertemporal ‘discount rate’ and increase consumer saving.As indicated, research has focused on only one mental pathway between these selves: from the present to the future. But just as people can start in the present and move forward in their minds, they can also start in the future and go back. In a pilot study, we asked Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) participants how they naturally travel through time, with the following prompt:There are two ways to think about time when we think about what sort of things are going to happen in the future. One way is to start right now in the present and mentally travel ahead to the future. Another way is to start in the future and mentally travel backward to the present.In line with the standard conception of time, participants were heavily skewed toward forward time travel: 83 per cent chose it as their primary mode of mental travel through time. But interestingly, just 27 per cent indicated that they only travel from the present to the future and never travel from the future to the present. This pilot study suggested that although beginning in the present is usually the default, it is not the only way to travel through time.Research in spatial travel suggests that features of a journey affect how long the journey seems to take. Trips to a known destination (e.g. home) seem faster than trips to an unknown destination, even if both legs involve the same objective distance. Although this ‘going-home effect’ relates to trips through physical space, mental travel through time shares many of the same characteristics.By integrating findings from mental time-travel research with the going-home effect, we reasoned that because people live in the present, the present self represents a temporal version of ‘home.’ By contrast, the future is a less certain destination because the future self exists away from the ‘home’ of the present self. If this theorizing holds, starting in the future and going home (to the present) might make the two points feel closer, which could induce a sense that the present and future selves are similar—that is, a temporal going-home effect.In sum, we felt that if traveling home in time, toward a certain, present self might make the future self seem more similar to the present self; this increased similarity between present and future selves may cause consumers to save more for the future.With spatial travel, the going-home effect results in part from uncertainty about the away location relative to the home location. As previous research has shown, when participants don’t know what they will be doing later in a different room, they report stronger experiences of the going-home effect after they return to the initial room. The uncertainty of what would happen made the trip to reach it feel relatively longer.Extrapolating to temporal travel, we posited that a temporal going-home effect could result from a similar sense of uncertainty about the future self, relative to the present self. Traveling back to a more certain destination (the present) might make someone feel closer and more connected to their selves across time, such that they appear more similar.Our ResearchWe investigated the potential consequences for savings behaviour linked to forward and reverse mental time travel. Across 20 studies, we manipulated the way consumers travel mentally through time, in an attempt to increase both feelings of similarity with their future selves and saving intentions and behaviour.We first examined whether changing the direction people travel mentally through time affects the similarity they perceive between their current and future self. In Study 1, we established that, in comparison to mentally traveling from the present to the future, traveling from the future to the present can affect similarity judgments across a six-year time horizon. Moreover, the effect of traveling from the future to the present affected judgments of similarity relative to a control condition. In three additional studies we replicated this effect across one, five and 10-year time frames.Also read: Life hacks you need to know to save money while studying abroadNext, we sought to identify the underlying mechanism for this. Study 2 showed that uncertainty linked to the ‘destination self’ accounts for the relationship between mental time-travel direction and similarity judgments. It also provided evidence that reducing the uncertainty of the destination self increases perceived similarity across a 10-year time horizon.In Study 3, our primary aim was to examine whether mentally traveling from the future to the present could increase saving intentions. In this study, we found support for the effect of our invention on saving intentions. That is, participants who traveled from the future to the present reported a higher intention of saving when offered an introductory 5% savings rate, were more likely to invest windfall gains by buying a Treasury bill and were less likely to plan to spend all the money now.The effect of mental time-travel direction on financial decision-making was not limited to 10-year savings goals. In Study 4, we examined whether starting in the future and mentally traveling back to the present affects consequential saving behaviour. Our aim was to pilot test the effect of mental time-travel direction in a consequential context. These findings provided preliminary evidence that traveling from the future to the present increases the likelihood that consumers will deposit real money in long-term savings products.In partnership with a financial technology company focused on college savings, we further investigated the impact of mental time-travel direction on savings behaviour. As predicted, relative to participants in the present-to-future condition, participants in the future-to-present condition were more likely to complete the onboarding user flow and receive $10 investments in their college savings account.Across mental time travel directions, participants traveling to a certain destination indicated higher similarity between their selves than participants traveling to an uncertain destination. A small effect of direction implied that participants in the future-to-present condition sensed greater similarity on average than participants in the present-to-future conditions.We also found an interaction between time travel direction and uncertainty, such that the effect of traveling to a certain (vs. uncertain) destination self was higher in the future-to-present condition. Overall, we found further support for uncertainty as a driver of the relationship between time travel direction and similarity judgments.Key TakeawaysBecause consumers frequently fail to save for the future at the rates they say they desire, we investigated a novel intervention to help close this gap: altering conventional mental time-travel directions, by traveling back to the present from the future.Across 20 experiments we demonstrated that mental time-travel direction affects how similarly consumers perceive their current and future selves and, in turn, the actions they take on behalf of those future selves.Also read: It is time to recognise the value of unpaid care work in economic growthRelative to mentally traveling from the present forward to the future, traveling from the future back to the present increased consumers’ perceived similarity between selves across time. Moreover, we found that uncertainty is a primary mechanism that underpins this effect. Ultimately, we established that backward mental time travel increases saving—albeit with small effects—in both hypothetical lab studies and incentivized field contexts.Our findings contribute to several streams of research. First, work on future self-continuity implies that when consumers feel psychologically similar to their future selves, they discount the future less. Although present and future selves are, by definition, separate, theorizing in this arena documents how and why people might regard them as more connected.We also contribute to the marketing literature on the going-home effect, which to date has been restricted to the spatial domain (i.e. felt distance between one place and another varies as a function of direction of travel.) Whereas trips through physical space often are measured in time (‘How long does it take to get there?’), trips through time often are measured in psychological closeness (‘How similar do you feel right now to yourself in ten years?’).Also read: 4 food items you can freeze to save moneyWe examined how traveling back to the present (i.e. the temporal home) affects closeness across time and found that, like travel through space, travel through time seems closer, and the two selves feel more similar, when traveling ‘home’ (to the present) than when traveling ‘away’ (to the future). This effect is driven by the certainty of the destination self.Uncertainty is fundamental not only to how consumers traverse time and space but also to how they make comparisons across different entities. Accordingly, we also advance the literature on ‘similarity judgments.’ Similarity judgments often compare better-known concepts (prototypes) with lesser-known concepts (variants).Research on feature matching also indicates a similarity–judgment asymmetry as a function of comparison directions. For example, a friend is likely to be judged as more similar to oneself than the self is to a friend. This asymmetry arises because when people start with more uncertain, lesser-known concepts and compare them with more well-known concepts, they know fewer features, load fewer features, and then identify a higher percentage of loaded features that match.To our knowledge, our research is the first to test this similarity asymmetry across time, in which one component of the comparison—the future self—does not yet exist. Even though the future self exists only once the present self ceases to exist, we found this similarity asymmetry still persists. By reversing the standard comparison—that is, by starting with the future self and comparing it with the present self—interventions can increase perceived similarity between selves across time.Finally, our research contributes to the literature on ‘backward planning,’ which indicates that working backward from a goal to the present can lead to more realistic estimations of task completion time. When planners start in the future (with their goals) and move back to the present, they arrive at longer time estimates for project completion than when they start in the present and move forward in time. Thus, compared with forward planners, backward planners are more likely to realize they need more time to achieve their goals and make the changes they want.Prior backward-planning research has investigated tasks that already are planned or in process; in contrast, we featured backward travel as a more general phenomenon, suggesting that traveling backward can create value even for consumers who do not already have savings plans.Compared with forward travelers, travelers who mentally go back to the present judge their future selves as more similar to their current selves, seemingly because traveling back to this known destination self leads to a sense that the future and present selves are not very different. Furthermore, when consumers’ future selves feel psychologically closer to their current selves, they are more likely to commit to saving and making investments to help their future selves.Managerial ImplicationsOur research has implications for companies, governments and individual decision-makers seeking to reduce savings shortfalls. Our field studies indicate the potential of mental time-travel directions to drive behavioural changes—in this case, among millennial investors in Sweden and investors in a college savings plan in the United States. Similar interventions might assist other institutions that seek to enhance future-oriented investments. For example, early claims of U.S. Social Security benefits can reduce retirees’ benefits by as much as 30 per cent over their lifespans.The time at which this intervention takes place may be critical, and future research could examine both timing and age effects. For example, in a retirement context, an intervention six months before beginning retirement may be too late to shift judgments, while 30 years before retirement may be too soon.Our findings also might apply to consumer and student loan debt. Temporal discounting not only affects the rates at which people save but also how much they choose to borrow and repay; research suggests students do not aim high enough and as a result may not borrow enough or invest enough in their education. A simple mental time-travel manipulation—before asking students how much they want to borrow—might change loan amounts.In closingAlthough human minds may tend to start in the present before moving to the future, they appear capable of more elaborate maneuvers. We offer reverse mental time travel as a promising intervention that alters how consumers relate to and make decisions for their present self and the self they will one day become.My co-authors and I believe that traveling back to the present might also exert similar effects in non-financial domains that benefit from greater perceived ‘future similarity’—including healthy eating, education, healthcare and exercise.Sam Maglio is a Professor of Marketing and Psychology at the University of Toronto Scarborough, with a cross-appointment to the Rotman School of Management.
