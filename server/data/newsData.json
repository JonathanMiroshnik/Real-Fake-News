The hacked information facilitated the tracking of the FBI official, enabling the cartel to identify and target informants.The exposure of these vulnerabilities highlights the growing threat of surveillance technologies. The Justice Department report calls for enhanced training for FBI personnel to address these emerging challenges, as less-sophisticated entities easily exploit these technological advancements.",

In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, the former vice president says she's staying in touch with Democrats on Capitol Hill and urging them to stand strong during the government shutdown. But she's also offering plenty of ideas about the future of the Democratic Party — and making clear she is part of it in some capacity. She has not ruled out running again in 2028. But she says that Democrats have a deep bench of leaders and potential presidential candidates. She cautioned against Democrats pining after “the one” party savior and called on them to let many voices be heard.",
