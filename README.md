**REAL FAKE NEWS**

A well designed news site where the content is entirely generated by AI Large Language Models. 
The website is meant to look like a "real" news site, with articles in different sections, different authors, events, editors, and so on.
To allow the site to be interesting on its own as parody site, the news items will be as fake as can be, and there will be an interactive elements
for the reader as well as backend interactions between the different "writers" and the "editor".

The tech stach will be MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

# Design
## Front-end
An example website that I use as a model is: https://www.ynet.co.il

The website will have the following elements:
- Logo -> A button to redirect to the home page
- Header -> Contains buttons to the various site sections
- Footer -> Will show information about the website creator and licensing information
- Article -> Will contain a timestamp of creation, an author name, and the content will be shown/saved in a markdown format.
- Home page -> At the top it will present the front-side article, then the other main articles, and then the other lesser sections and articles.

### Possible additions:
- Carousel/News Ticker/Slideshow -> This will show the most recent events/articles in a shortened format and will act as buttons towards the related content.
- Simple weather description -> This will be a real weather element that will pull from real data sources to show the current weather in various places
- Local time clock
- Fake sponsors -> To be added to the footer
- Comments section in an article -> along with "totally not fake" bot comments
- Login option through Google or Facebook which allow to leave a comment
- RSS for articles
- Share button in articles
- Search button -> This will allow a user to search through the articles in the website according to key words 
- Automatically generated images in the middle of articles -> and also for banners for the articles
- A tip jar for the humble creator of said website
- Dark/Light mode button

## Back-end
The backend will need to have the following parts for the website to work:

1. A safe and cheap way of connecting to Large Language Models. We will use the OpenAI API in Node and DeepSeek(as it is quite cheap).
2. A complex state machine that takes all existing articles/writers into consideration and chooses the next operation in the website accordingly.
Writers will interact with other writers, discuss with the editors, and will form simple relationships and life histories of their own that will
effect their reporting.
3. MongoDB database that will save the articles, the writers and the state as described above. There is also a possibility of saving generated images too.

# Lessons learned:
- DON'T install npm and node through apt-get, instead, install nvm and use _THAT_ to install those properly: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/ + https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
- DON'T use "npx create-react-app" because it has constant issues, instead, use Vite: https://vite.dev/guide/ -> For the frontend "client", I used the command: "npm create vite@latest client -- --template react-ts"
- For the Node backend with TypeScript and Express I used the tutorial: https://medium.com/@vihangamallawaarachchi.dev/setting-up-a-node-js-and-express-backend-with-typescript-a-comprehensive-guide-b15fad5c803c
- For the final Node backend typescript config file, I used the tutorial: https://www.totaltypescript.com/tsconfig-cheat-sheet
- To allow for React/Node servers to start up by default on FireFox, you need to install the VSC extension "Debugger for FireFox" and configure the launch.json accordingly. **DOESNT WORK**
